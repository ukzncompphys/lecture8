The factor of 2 comes from the fact that we are pulling the left and
right neighbours to calculate the derivative.  Since each point is dx
away from our central point, the total distance between the left and
right neighbours is 2dx, so when calculating the numerical derivative,
we need to divide by 2dx rather than just dx.
